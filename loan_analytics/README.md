# Project: Loan Analytics

This loan calculator will help you determine the monthly payments on a loan. Simply enter the loan amount, term and interest rate in the fields below and click calculate. This calculator can be used for mortgage, auto, or any other fixed loan types.



The application has two major sections:

- Loan Forms - Enter information about your loans, including principal, interest rate, payment, extra payment for each loan. If you have some contributors that help you pay for the debt together, you can specify their contributions in the form.

- Summary - overview of calculations, including total amount of payments, amortization schedule, and some visualization about your loans and how much influence your contributors can bring to interest and time-to-loan-termination.
